# Neglect the Plates
"Neglect the Plates" is a single page application built in 5 days with a team of two for Lighthouse Web Dev Bootcamp's mid-term project. This app simulates a food ordering website where a user can place orders to local restaurants, and receive SMS confirmation of the order details.
